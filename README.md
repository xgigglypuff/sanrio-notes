  <p>This web application is a Sanrio-themed "post-it" style live notes app created with React, JS, SCSS, and a Firebase DB on the backend. Users can create notes, move them in 3 different planes, edit, delete, and clear them. The notes are   draggable and have markdown support. Each note can be customized and coded with a different Sanrio character: Hello Kitty, Kuromi, My Melody, Pompompurin, and Keroppi. Each character code group has a different color scheme for the         background, text, and accent colors. All of this data is stored and saved. This persistent storage and update of notes is hosted with Firebase. </p>
